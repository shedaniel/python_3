# MIT Python 3 Learning
This is a python learning!

## Documentation
The basics of python is easy.
```python
print("Hello World")
```
This is a basic print() function.


To make a new line, demonstrated here:
```python
print("\nHello xDD")
```


Varibles in python is actually pretty easy!   
Just simply do:
```python
name = "Daniel"
```
It will automatically set its type!


Simple numbers like this:
```python
a = 10
```


You can do simple calculations:
```python
a = 10
b = a + 14
```


Making lists are actually easier then you think!
```python
list = [10, 11, 12]
```
To get the first number, simply do:
```python
list[0]
```


More list utils:
```python
#Adding a item at the back
list.append(123)

#Adding a item in a index
list.insert(2, 3123)

#Remove Daniel
list.remove(123)

#Remove the first one
list.pop(0)
```


To make a infinite loop, try this:
```python
while True:
  #Random Stuff...
```


Next, we are trying string index.
This code gets the length of a string:
```python
stringLength = len("A Random String")
```


For loop for each char in the string
```python
s = "A Random String"
for letter in s:
  print(s)
```

Fun Stuff:
```python
text = "123456789abcdefg"
#Print with spaces
println(text[..2])

#Print a random number from 1 to 9
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 9)
print(random_number)

#Split a string with spaces xD
message = "I love Danielshe!"
message_list = message.split()
```


This is almost the documentation of what I learned in python. But I didn't write the documentation for reading files, explore yourself!
